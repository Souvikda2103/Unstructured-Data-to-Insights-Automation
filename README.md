# 📄 Unstructured Data to Insights Automation  
🔗 👉 Workflow: Automated Invoice Processing (Google Drive → OCR → AI → Google Sheets)

---

## 🎯 Objective  
To build an end-to-end automation system that reads unstructured invoice files (PDF & images) from Google Drive, extracts key details using OCR + Google Gemini, and updates Google Sheets with clean, structured data — eliminating manual entry, errors, and repetitive work.

---

## 🧾 What This Automation Does  

This workflow fully automates the journey from raw invoice files to structured data:

- Automatically scans an invoice folder in **Google Drive**  
- Handles **PDF** and **image (PNG/JPG)** formats  
- Extracts text using either File Reader or OCR  
- Uses Google Gemini to pull out structured fields  
- Validates and cleans extracted data  
- Updates two Google Sheets:
  - **Invoice Details**
  - **Invoice Items**

✨ A single click processes all invoices end-to-end.
